## Exercise 3

* Create an `_extensions` folder in the same directory as your `.qmd` file.

* Move your `styles.scss` file from Exercise 2 into the `_extensions` folder.

* Create an `_extension.yml` file in the `_extensions` folder.

* Write the YAML code specifying the:

  * extension title
  * author name
  * version number
  * contribution (HTML format with the `styles.scss` styling)
  
* Edit the YAML in the `.qmd` file to use this extension.

* Bonus: create a GitHub repository and add your `_extensions` folder to it.
